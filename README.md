This repository contains my references for repairing the discontinued Logitech Trackball (I only experienced with the 4-button version).

The main failure point for these trackball is the buttons, becoming unreliable, either not clicking or always double/triple clicking. 

I got inspired from two contributions:
 * This youtube video detailing how to change the mouse microswitches: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGf5q5bjra0
 * These designs and instructions to reinforce the mouse internal structure: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3416522 (Note, there are also upgrade instructions for the 2-button version here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4754168)

The proposed design is required at a much later stage than what I did for my mouse: they require removing the internal support structure of the button PCB and replacing it completely with a 
printed model.

In my case, the internal structure holding the PCB was still sound but it became a bit soft, making the PCB wiggle and reducing the reliability of the button. The design here keeps the internal structure
and fits snuggly around it, supporting and rigidifying the PCB. After implementing on my two mice, I identified that one switch was reliably double-clicking. I replaced it following the instructions in the
video and the mouse is good to go.
